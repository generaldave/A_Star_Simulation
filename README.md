A* search simulator

- Uing p5js
- Based on a small series of video by Daniel Shiffman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k

App visualizes an A* search algorithm. The "maze" is to find it's way from the top left corner to the bottom right. The black squares represent walls, that are not passable. The pastel-ish red are squares that were already evaluated and the pastel-ish green are squares that are in line to be evaluated.

In the end, the app tells the user whether it is done or if there is no solution.

Run the app by opening index.html in a browser.
